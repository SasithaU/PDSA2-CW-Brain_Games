# Solves the 8-Queens puzzle using a sequential backtracking algorithm.
# Measures how long it takes to find all solutions.
# Saves each solution (as a comma-separated string) into the sequential_solutions table in the database.
# Also saves the total time taken into the timings table for performance tracking.
# Prints how many solutions were inserted and how long the process took.
